		<name>Body Harvest</name>
		<desc>The year is 2016. Humanity has been reduced to a few survivors inhabiting the orbital space station Omega. Over the course of the history, aliens visited the Earth every twenty-five years, "harvesting" humans as an organic material. Eventually, they launch an assault on the last remnants of the human race. But Adam Drake, a genetically engineered soldier, comes into possession of a time-traveling device. He uses it to travel to the time periods of human history when aliens performed their deadly attacks. The fate of humanity is in his hands.

Body Harvest is an action and driving game with a mission-based structure. The protagonist travels to various locations and eras (e.g. Greece during World War II, Siberia in the 1990s, etc.) with the goal of stopping alien invasions. Missions can be accessed by traveling to specified areas on the map. Adam can move on foot and use his weapons to kill aliens; however, vehicles usually prove to be a more reliable way of tackling most missions. Adam can use most of his weapons while in a vehicle; in addition, some vehicles are outfitted with their own weapons.</desc>

Like the PC version released in 1995, C&amp;C focuses on the war between two ficitional organizations - The Brotherhood of NOD &amp; the Global Defense Initiative. When a mysterious resource called Tiberium emerged on Earth, a conflict developed between both factions, as the GDI wanted to contain the biological material while the Brotherhood wanted to harness it.

15 missions on either side are available in which various units and structures, including artillery, tanks or light infantry, have to be used adequately to crush the enemy base, find traitors, protect vehicles or conquer certain areas.</desc>

		<desc>The day after his 21st birthday bash, Conker's sporting the worst hangover ever, and he just can't seem to find his way home. Prepare to stagger through randy, raunchy, raucous scenarios crammed full of bad manners, twisted humor, and graphic bodily functions. Unless you're a fan of violence, foul language, and racy innuendo, you'd best steer clear of this one.

Although visually similar to Rare's family-oriented Nintendo 64 platform games Banjo-Kazooie and Donkey Kong 64, Conker's Bad Fur Day was designed for mature audiences and features graphic violence, alcohol and tobacco use, profanity, vulgar humor and pop culture references. It was developed over the course of four years and was originally intended for a family audience, but was ultimately retooled into its current form because previews were criticised for being both too cute and similar to Rare's earlier platform games.</desc>

		<desc>Timber the Tiger's parents go on vacation and leave their son in charge of the island they live on, leaving him and his friends to race for fun. Their enjoyment is derailed when an evil, intergalactic, pig wizard named Wizpig arrives at peaceful Timber's Island and attempts to take over after he conquered his own planet's racetracks. He turns the four island's guardians: Tricky the Triceratops, Bubbler the Octopus, Bluey the Walrus and Smokey the Dragon into his henchmen. The only solution available to the island's inhabitants is to defeat Wizpig in an elaborate series of races that involves cars, hovercrafts, and airplanes. Drumstick, the best racer on the island, failed this challenge and was transformed into a frog by Wizpig's black magic. Timber recruits a team of 7 racers: Diddy Kong, the first recruit; Conker (Dixie Kong on DS), recruited by Diddy; Banjo (Tiny Kong on DS), also recruited by Diddy; Krunch, Diddy's enemy who follows after him; Tiptup, an inhabitant of Timber's island; Pipsy, another inhabitant of Timber's island; and Bumper, another inhabitant of Timber's island. They eventually complete all of Wizpig's challenges and confront Wizpig himself to a race and defeat him. Shortly afterwards, Wizpig leaves for his home planet, Future Fun Land. Fearing that Wizpig would again attempt to invade Timber's Island, the islanders travel to Future Fun Land for a second challenge. When Wizpig loses the second race, the rocket he rides on malfunctions and blasts him to a distant planet and peace returns to Timber Island for good.</desc>

		<desc>The last first-party title to be released for the Japanese N64 is also one of the quirkiest. Billed as a communication game, players are free to roam about a small forest community, talk to animals, run chores and slowly learn what peace and harmony are all about. While there is tons of Japanese text to wade through, the gameplay is very rewarding. The graphics are typical Nintendo fare – cute, but imaginative enough to appeal to older gamers as well. But perhaps the most attractive part of the game to foreign players are the many emulated NES classics you can play as you progress through the game. Although not released in the US or Europe, Nintendo ported the N64 game to GameCube and brought the title to the west in its upgraded form.</desc>

Each car has eight technical settings that can be tweaked to your taste, or you can just trust the judgment of the mechanic. Try out Solo mode; Time Attack (a race against your own best time); World Championship; Split-Screen Duel; and the helpful Driving School mode. Awesome graphics and true-to-life F-1 physics make this the most harrowing racing game to date, and impressive computer AI will have you working at this beast for quite awhile.</desc>

It was also the first game to feature a block containing teams which did not pertain to any of the main leagues (back then, it was known as "Rest of Europe" since all teams were European, the vast majority of them featured either in the 1998-99 season of the UEFA Cup or Champions League).

Graphically, it is a major improvement over FIFA '98, with the inclusion of basic facial animations and different players' heights as well as certain other cosmetic features such as improved kits and emblems, although they are unlicensed. Gamers may also create their own custom cups and leagues and select the teams they wish to participate.</desc>

		<desc>UNRELEASED

Frogger 2: Swampy's Revenge is a video game released in 2000. The game is part of the Frogger series, and the sequel to the 1997 remake of Frogger, featuring similar 4-way movement gameplay in a 3D world and 6 different environments. Unlike its predecessor, Frogger 2 featured a choice of different characters to play with in the game, several multiplayer modes, and an in-game storyline. A Nintendo 64 port of the game was planned, but it was cancelled.

The sequel to the Original classic (and the so-so 1997 release) changes the way you look at frogs! The stage is set for a totally new adventure where Frogger and his female friend Lillie Frog will need to leap over, dive under, hop through and climb above endless new obstacles and challenges to save the Frog Babies from Frogger's new arch enemy, the dastardly Swampy the Crocodile.</desc>

However, Skorne crushed Garm and imprisoned his soul in the Underworld. Skorne, fearing the power of the Runestones, scattered them throughout the four realms, so that they could never be used against him. The player(s) must defeat the end bosses of each of the four realms to obtain the four golden keys which allow access to Skorne's temple. While traveling through each realm, he/she/they must also collect the Thirteen Runestones from where they have been scattered. The complete set of Runestones allows him/her/them to pursue Skorne to the Underworld in order to finally destroy him. The players must find 3 rune stones on each kingdom in order to defeat Skorne in the Underworld, and of course 1 from the battle grounds.</desc>

This version featured a new level, which replaced the secret levels. "Gecques Cousteau", which is centered on the RMS Titanic, is played almost entirely underwater. The only land parts of the level are at the entrance to the Titanic, which is sunk by the iceberg.

Other changes include fewer bonus levels and fewer quotes, due to the Nintendo 64 cartridges storing significantly less data for games than CDs. Some of the sound effects were altered slightly.</desc>

		<desc>In a peaceful, idyllic kingdom, a kindly wizard rules over various lands from his large castle. The beauty and harmony of the kingdom are protected by seven magical crystals, which sit on the spires of the castle. The wizard is aided in his magic by a pair of magic, four-fingered gloves, which are sentient. One day, though, the wizard accidentally mixes together a bad batch of potions, which create a massive explosion. The mishap turns the wizard into a statue, and sends his magic gloves in two directions—one flies out the window, while the other lands in a cauldron. The explosion also shakes the crystals from the spires, and they hurtle to the ground. The glove that landed outside—Glover—quickly casts a spell to transform the crystals into rubber balls to prevent them from shattering on the ground. They bounce away, entering the magical realms around the kingdom. Without the crystals, though, the world transforms into a foggy, desolate wasteland. To make matters worse, the other glove is corrupted by the potion in the cauldron and becomes the villain, Cross-Stitch.</desc>

		<desc>INDY RACING 2000 for the Nintendo 64 combines realistic racing simulations and far-out arcade racers to make a game that closely follows the rules, but is still a lot of fun to play. There are many modes such as Practice, Race, Competition, and Championship. Before each race, the player can choose one of 20 real-life drivers and their actual vehicle. Players also have the ability to customize the car as desired, by adjusting everything from the tire pressure to the transmission. In addition to the official Indy Racing League tracks, there are road courses to race on as well. Players will have to race their hardest, as the cartridge will save all of their racing data so that they can compare their stats to a friend, or even race one in the Multiplayer mode. INDY RACING 2000 manages to keep the franchise fresh by offering plenty of tracks and options, with great racing fun in the lead.</desc>

		<desc>Kemco offers up a title that introduces brand new gameplay concepts to the Nintendo 64 with KNIFE EDGE: Nose Gunner. The storyline takes the player to Mars and beyond, battling against enemies of an alien variety. The gameplay takes classic shooting action and sticks it in a first-person perspective, resulting in an intense and action-packed affair. However, the levels are not free roaming, as the action travels along predetermined rails that offer multiple paths to be determined by the player. In addition to the one-player Story mode, there is a Practice mode that allows the player to sharpen their shooting skills. To appease fans of multiplayer, there is the option to play with up to four people in the Story mode, as well as fight against each other in the Team Battle mode. KNIFE EDGE: Nose Gunner for the Nintendo 64 offers a large amount of options and modes, as well as an exciting shooting adventure that is truly unique among N64 titles.</desc>

		<desc>In Lego Racers, the player assumes the role of either one of several pre-built Lego characters or a custom-built driver.  The camera is positioned behind the car, as in most racing games, and the player may make use of a variety of power-ups such as weapons and speed-boosters to increase their chances of winning.  The game supports keyboard and gamepad control, both of which can be fully customized in the game settings.  Customization: A feature in the game allows the player to build cars and drivers of their own design.  Both the driver's Lego minifigure and the car are built from scratch using a wide selection of Lego bricks and parts.  This selection is limited when the player starts the game but expands each time the player completes a circuit.  The player may also use the Quick Build feature to play with a pre-made car.  Customization is purely aesthetic and has no effect on the performance of the car.</desc>

		<desc>The game mechanics are similar to the original; you outrun 'monsters' by using alternate routes, sliding on ropes, climbing ladders or drilling holes in the ground to trap them.  This game differs from the other incarnations of games from the series because of its apparent three-dimensional perspective.  While essentially running in 2-dimensional space, the player has an option to move in another direction every so often.  The levels are mostly spirals that require climbing to complete.  There are five worlds and each one must be unlocked by finding five cards from the previous world excluding the first.  Each world is divided into five stages with each stage divided into four levels.  The general goal of each level is to collect a certain amount of gold to activate a portal that allows the player to continue.  As the player progresses, each world adds new interactive objects and tools as well as new obstacles.</desc>

		<name>Mario Party</name>
		<desc>Every game in the main series has a standard Party Mode in which up to four players play through a board, trying to collect as many stars as possible. In every turn, each player rolls a die and progresses on the board, which usually has branching paths. Coins are primarily earned by performing well in a minigame played at the end of each turn. On most boards, players earn stars by reaching a star space and purchasing a star for a certain amount of coins. The star space appears randomly on one of several pre-determined locations and moves every time a star is purchased, usually occupying a blue space.
Every Mario Party contains at least 50 to almost 110 minigames with a few different types. Four-player games are a free-for-all in which players compete individually. In 2-on-2 and 1-on-3 minigames, players compete as two groups, cooperating to win, even though they are still competing individually in the main game. Some minigames in Mario Party are 4-player co-op, even though it doesn't say it. In most situations, winners earn ten coins each.</desc>

		<name>MRC: Multi-Racing Championship</name>
		<desc>Featuring up to 10 chooseable cars (many which open up later in the game), and three courses (plus mirror courses), Multi Racing Championship's biggest draw is the splendidly realistic feel of the cars themselves and the well designed courses on which they drive. The cars range from 4X4s, trucks, and off-road racers to slick street cars, Lamborghinis and the like. While initially it may seem like there is a deficit of courses, in fact, the multi-terrain courses contain mini-courses within each one. For instance, at least three times in each course, you will have the choice to take two different road directions -- either rough dirt track or snow-laden road, ot a slick but usually longer street course. Each car handles terrains differently, and some, like the trucks, obviously handle the off-roads better than others, but you can also modify your street car to handle dirst roads well, too.</desc>

		<desc>The NBA Live series of basketball video games, published by EA Sports, is currently one of the leading National Basketball Association simulations on the market.

Starting from NBA Live 2000, the series featured NBA Live Legend All-Stars Teams, that included some biggest names from five decades (50s to 90s). These teams could be used instantly, but to use the players as regular players (e.g. traded, played on regular NBA Teams) they needed to be unlocked. Along the series, some of the rosters were changed due to many reasons as Michael Jordan was on the 90's team through 2004.</desc>

Called Shinseki Evangelion in Japan, the Gainax-produced anime series originally aired from October '95 to March '96 and soon spawned a feature movie release in '97. The N64 game starts in the year 2015, 15 years after Second Impact. The Angels have returned and suddenly attack Tokyo-3. Using so-called "terror-fields" that cannot be penetrated by ordinary weapons, the Angels are taking on every human force sent out to oppose them. That's where you come in. As the pilot of the NERV-designed Evangelions, Shinji Ikari, you take your giant humanoid combat mech into battle with the Angels. Gameplay can best be described as interactive anime, as it relies heavily on timed button presses.</desc>

With full licenses from the NFL and its athletes, the game has all 31teams and 1500 players, plus perfect replication of logos and stadiums.

Not only that, you can create players, teams, playbooks (with up 128 offensive plays), and profiles of chosen formations and pass-run ratios. There’s even a historical mode that allows you to tap into classic games of yesteryear, featuring teams that date back to 1967. ESPN’s Mike Patrick and Randy Cross chime in with commentary, and Brett Favre has returned yet again to add his insight. Throw a dozen camera angles into the mix, and you’ve got yourself a football game.</desc>

		<name>Nightmare Creatures</name>
		<desc>The story behind Nightmare Creatures draws upon gothic horror elements of the 19th century. The story begins in 1666, when a devil-worshipping cult called the Brotherhood of Hecate were conducting sinister experiments in London so as to take over the city and then the world. The Brotherhood tried to develop an elixir that would endow them with superhuman powers. However, rather than creating their intended superhumans, their experiments created only grotesque monsters. When they decided to use these creatures as an army of conquest, one of their number, Samuel Pepys, set their headquarters on fire, resulting in the First Great Fire of London. The game takes place in 1834 when London falls victim to several evil occurrences. Monster sightings are reported along with news of people mutating into ungodly creatures, and that the dead are waking from their graves and walking amongst the living. All of London is in a panic and vulnerable to the schemes of Adam Crowley, a mad scientist and occultist enlisting the help of the Brotherhood.</desc>

The story follows Magnus Gallant, a recent graduate of the Ischka Military Academy, and fledgling captain in Palatinus' Southern region, Alba. As civil war erupts in the country, Magnus eventually decides to join the revolution with its leader, Frederick Raskin, first liberating the southern region with the Zenobians' aid, then Nirdam and uniting with them, then returning the Eastern Region of Capitrium to the Orthodox church, and finally marching on the capital of Latium. However, along the way, Magnus' battalion, the Blue Knights, finds its enemies escalating, from the puppet kingdom of Palatinus, to the might of the Holy Lodis Empire, to the Dark Hordes of the Netherworld.</desc>

		<desc>The game is a 3D RPG in which the player character is a child who starts a journey to become a monster breeder on his tenth birthday. After receiving and hatching an egg, the player walks around the world, completing requests from people and raising monsters. Requests are basic RPG quests—such as collecting an item for a non-playable character—and the monsters fight in Pokémon-style, turn-based battles. Unlike Pokémon, every monster in the game comes from the one baby that the player receives as their first monster. Depending on the food it is fed, the monster gains element points, which determine how it evolves. Monsters level up both through defeating other monsters and when walking around the town. Monsters hatch from eggs that can be bought at the local monster shop.</desc>

To achieve this objective, you must avoid missiles launched by your competitors, among other things. One way to counter this is the barrel roll maneuver, which is a quick and effective way to avoid unexpected hurdles on the tracks. In the beginning, you drive a pretty unimpressive racer. However, if you beat the competition and place in the top three, your reward is the chance to upgrade your car. Be merciless and steal the losing racers' special features, such as engine and armor upgrades, special attack abilities, and enhancing cosmetic features for the car. You have 13 different racer body styles and nine tracks to choose from. The cartoony racers zip through city streets, ice caves, and a volcano, and with the Track Create mode, you can design the wildest track you can imagine. When you toss four-player racing into the fray, the fun quadruples as the action intensifies and the losers are utterly humiliated.</desc>

		<name>Premier Manager 64</name>
		<desc>Football management simulation in the Actua Sports line from Gremlin. The game, endorsed by Kevin Keegan, lets you take over the manager's reins of a soccer club in any of the English Leagues, be it the Premier League or the low lights of the Third Division. But this is no ordinary football game. Unlike others on the N64, PM is a management simulation, and you never actually take control of a match by controlling individual players. Instead, you pick the lineup, your own formation and the tactics of how the team should play. Then you let your players go off and do the work on their own. This makes the whole game harder since you never have direct control over the actions of the players -- instead, you have to hope that you picked the right combination of players and the right tactics to do the job. Released only in Europe.</desc>

		<name>Puyo Puyoon Party</name>
		<desc>This game was released only in Japan. It is the fourth game in the Puyo Puyo series and the last set during the Madou-era in the main series.
Continuing the trend of naming the games after puns, the name comes from a pun on "yon", the Japanese word for the number 4, but this time this is the only reference to the pun.

The gameplay in is similar to that of Puyo Puyo 2, but adds super attacks. Clearing chains now builds up a "charge meter" which allows players to use them. The only other addition was a new game mode which could be played with a number of different field sizes, smaller or bigger than the standard 6x12, however, it removes several game modes that were present in Puyo Puyo Sun, i.e. the tournament, task and chain training modes. The art is also vastly different to the previous game in the series and, of course, the Fever series; this style was only otherwise used for Minna de Puyo Puyo.

STORY: 
Satan has released an odd demon called Pierott. Pierott invites Arle and Carbuncle over to the “Puyo Puyo Circus”. All seemed to be just fine, Arle and Carbuncle went into a tent to watch a magic show, but Satan had Carbuncle volunteer for a magic trick he was doing. A magic trick? Or a trap? He puts Carbuncle on the stand, and casts a spell, which makes Carbuncle, disappear! Arle wasn't worried, she didn't even know what was going on, but later on, she couldn't find Carbuncle anywhere! She then has to start battling monsters and oddball characters in a match of Puyo Puyo to try to reach Satan, and get Carbuncle back!

This version of the game have different music and lacks the voiced cutscenes due to cartridge's memory limitations, but can be played in 4-player mode like the Dreamcast version and included a Transfer Pack mode where one could unlock more artwork by plugging in Pocket Puyo Puyo Sun.</desc>

		<desc>Puyo Puyo SUN (ぷよぷよSUN Puyopuyo San?) is the third installment of the Puyo Puyo games series, and the sequel to Puyo Puyo Tsu, made in 1996 by Compile. After the highly acclaimed success of its predecessor, Compile took a slightly more retro approach, so players had a more original feel to the game over that of Tsu.

The name of Puyo Puyo SUN comes from a Japanese pun on san, and also indicates a new Puyo brought into the game. As Sun Puyo were used in this game, and the game itself is not only set on a tropical beach, but is the third in the series (san (三?) is the Japanese word for the number three), the name served multiple purposes.</desc>

		<desc>Basics:
The game is similar in play to a toned-down Marvel vs. Capcom. The button layout is the fighting game standard six-buttons (Three punches and three kicks.), which produce special moves when combined with various directional commands. All characters have a single-button attack that sends the opponent into the air, where they can pursue them and follow up with an aerial attack. Perhaps to complement this, each character can perform an additional jump while in the air.

Magic:
Super Combos in this game are referred to as "Magic" and a player can have up to three levels of Magic (Represented by three crayons that appear at the bottom of the screen.). Super Meter levels can be spent in three ways: Offense (An attack that causes heavy damage with a few hits.), Defense (An attack that causes little damage, but sends the opponent far away.) and Counter (Usable only while the character is blocking, causes medium damage and sends the opponent flying away, like Defense Magic.)</desc>

Globox, a friend of Rayman, is later also captured and put in the same cell as Rayman aboard the Pirates' prison ship.

He learns that in order to stand a chance against the Pirates, he needs to find 4 ancient, magic masks to awaken Polokus, the spirit of the world.[10] He travels through the Glade of Dreams via the Hall of Doors, a magical place linked to various locations in the world, controlled by the ancient Teensies.</desc>

		<name>Ready 2 Rumble Boxing</name>
		<desc>Ready 2 Rumble Boxing is a boxing game for the Dreamcast, PlayStation, Game Boy Color, and Nintendo 64 and it was released in 1999 by Midway. The success of the Dreamcast version led to it becoming one of the few Sega All Stars titles.

Like Nintendo's Punch-Out!! series it features many characters with colorful personalities (i.e. Afro Thunder, Boris "The Bear" Knokimov, etc.); however, unlike the Punch-Out!! series, Ready 2 Rumble Boxing is in 3D, thus allowing for more control over your character in the ring, and also enables the players to choose whichever fighters they want.

Throughout the fights in the game, there is a special RUMBLE meter which fills up, one letter at a time, until the word "RUMBLE" is spelled at the bottom of the screen. Letters can be obtained by successfully landing hard blows or taunting the opponent. Once the meter is full, the player can power himself up, enabling access to a special move called "Rumble Flurry", which might as well instantly knock the opposite player out cold.

One unique graphic feature of the game is the gradual bruises gained by players as the fight progresses (like hematomas and swellings), present in all fifth-generation versions. While this is not necessarily a new feature to games (it had been implemented before in SNK's 1992 game Art of Fighting), it garnered much appraisal from reviewers, because of the added fun factor this element supply to the game</desc>

Letters also appear when the fighter taunts his opponent. Once the word is formed, powerful combo attacks can be activated that will almost definitely knock the opponent down. This time, however, there are three levels of "RUMBLE", which build up one after the other. If the player successfully lands a combo with his RUMBLE Meter full on the third level (where the letters start smoking), the final blow can launch the opponent clear out of the ring, giving the player an instant victory.</desc>

		<name>Rocket: Robot on Wheels</name>
		<desc>First-time Nintendo 64 developer Sucker Punch Studios jumped onto the scene with a highly original 3D platformer. The design philosophy behind the title is simple -- rather than build the platformer around the main character, the software house opted instead to focus on the interactivity of the 3D environments he travels. To that end, Rocket employs an advanced physics engine which allows the main character, a lovable unicycle-based robot named Rocket, to travel and experiment with colorful, platform-esque worlds with realistic gravity and inertia. Every object has its own set of lifelike attributes that must be "weighed" into consideration when solving puzzles.</desc>

		<name>Rugrats: Scavenger Hunt</name>
		<desc>In their big debut on the Nintendo 64, the favorite cartoon babies are about to get wrapped up in the scavenger hunt to end all scavenger hunts. Featuring three different board games, RUGRATS: Scavenger Hunt utilizes the animation and humor from the cartoon series, and melds it into an original game that has players traipsing through 3D worlds looking for hidden objects. In "The Pirate Treasure Hunt," the babies travel underwater in search of items; "Angelica's Temple of Gloom" challenges players to find bits of Stu's broken Aztec statues before Angelica can; and "Reptar Rally" has the babies collecting sweets in Candy Island. Once you choose your baby from a list that includes Tommy, Chuckie, Phil, or Lil, you begin using a spinner (just like a board game spinner) to determine how many spaces you'll advance. There are lots of trick spaces that give you advantages or disadvantages, like the Spike the Dog spot (which allows you to ride the pet for five spaces), and a Dil spot (which makes Dil come out and shuffle the board). Don't get too worked up though, as each baby has an energy meter, and if it hits zero you'll have to take a nap.</desc>

		<desc>In this game players take control of cars that take the shape of different animals. The game itself takes the role as a combat racing game as it features weapons to use against your opposition while racing, and the computers can do the same to you. The game has four modes: Grand Prix, Challenge and Time Attack.

The object of this game is to compete in the Grand Prix and to unlock new tracks and cars. The difficulty of each tournament is determined by which cup you choose to race for. The first cup you race for is the Carbon cup, and once you've beaten that you will unlock other cups that are based on elements like crystal, and diamond. Once you have won a tournament you will unlock a new cup to compete for, new levels to race in, and the chance to challenge other cars to gain access to them for use in Grand Prix races and vs mode.

While Racing you can acquire weapons located around the tracks to help you finish the race quicker or to slow down your opponents so you can overtake them. The combat system is different from many games, except for having health and being destroyed for a limited amount of time, if you or an enemy is hit by a weapon you will be temporarily be slowed downed which gives your opponent time to overtake you. They're some weapons that can be avoided by using your cars jump jets; all cars have jump jets and can be used to avoid certain weapons, however not all weapons can be avoided even with the Jump Jets.

The weapons are: turbo boost, magnets, seeker-style missiles, a boomerang, time bombs, stingers, stoppers, rounds of bullets, and a shield.</desc>

		<name>Saikyou Habu Shougi</name>
		<desc>Saikyo Habu Shougi (lit. Strongest Habu Shogi) is a Japanese virtual board game for the Nintendo 64 developed and published by Seta. It was released exclusively in Japan on June 23, 1996 as one of the Nintendo 64's three Japanese launch games alongside Super Mario 64 and Pilotwings 64.  It was the only launch game to use the Controller Pak.  The game's "special guest" is the shogi player Yoshiharu Habu, who won all seven major shogi championships the year of the game's release.  Though it was anticipated that the game would be a bestseller and a major showcase for the Nintendo 64's processing power, sales were not high, with only about one copy accompanying every one hundred consoles sold at the system launch.  Seta released a sequel titled Morita Shogi 64, which was announced at Nintendo Space World in 1996.</desc>

The game features a futuristic representation of San Francisco and an arcade-style physics engine. It also features a multiplayer mode for up to four players and Rumble Pak support on the Nintendo 64 port. A major difference in game play compared to predecessors in the series is the ability to extend wings from the cars in midair and glide. As with previous titles in the franchise, Rush 2049 features a stunt mode in which the player scores points for complex mid-air maneuvers and successful landings. There is also a multiplayer deathmatch battle mode. There are six race tracks, four stunt arenas, eight battle arenas, and one unlockable obstacle course named The Gauntlet. The single player race mode places emphasis on outlandish and death-defying shortcuts in each track. The game has a soundtrack mostly comprising techno music.</desc>

A few new "natural" disasters were also included, most of them being giant monster attacks (players were able to use their monster to fight against them).
SimCity 2000 puts an entire city in the palm of your hand. SimCity 2000 lets you create, build, and run a city of your own. Take on the role as a mayor and call the shots for the entire city. You'll have to keep up on the housing, industries, mass transportation, and commerce to attract potential citizens. And just when you think you have it under control, a natural disaster or alien invasion may occur to set you back. However, if you can conquer all of these problems, you just might be able to turn a small town into a thriving metropolis.</desc>

		<name>Snowboard Kids</name>
		<desc>The kids are arguing about their snowboarding skills. The debate escalates to the point where they decide to hold a snowboarding tournament to determine who is the best. One character, Shinobin, has no involvement whatsoever until he is unlocked by the player.

In addition to the usual gameplay of a snowboarding game, Snowboard Kids adds "Shots" (special weapons used to attack players) and items which can help the player, hinder other players, or both.

The game has nine main courses. Although some of the courses are snowy mountains, many are courses that would be unorthodox for snowboarding in the real world. Such courses include an amusement park, a desert, a vast valley, a dark highway, and a Japanese village during the cherry blossom festival.

There were several game mechanics that were unique to Snowboard Kids from other snowboard games and racing games at the time. One was the addition of the second item slot, allowing each player to carry a shooting item and support item (such as a rock, or invisibility) at the same time. Also, players needed to pay 100 gold in order to grab an item during the race, which could be obtained either through performing tricks or collecting coins scattered across the course. All courses also required players to race down the hill for multiple laps. Once a player had reached the bottom of the hill, he or she would need to pass through the lift gate to be transported back to the top of the hill, and could not be attacked by other players in this transition.</desc>

		<desc>The game is set in Snow Town, which is the main hometown of the protagonists. The plot follows the daily lives and adventures of the kids, and the rather ridiculous attempts of Damien to sabotage them.

The gameplay of this game is almost identical to its predecessor's, but with a few differences.

There are now three distinct playing modes: the Story mode, which follows the game plot and uses the classical system of cash prizes by winning the races; the battle mode, which includes multiplayer mode; and the Training mode.

There were new additions and changes to the Items and Shots. All of them were redesigned and the Shots were renamed as Weapons. Additions include the Rocket, the Wings and the Whirlwind (see more below). Other changes to the Items and Weapons include the reduction in the freeze time when a character is hit by the Freezing Shot, and the effect of losing coins when hit by a Slapstick.

The special tricks (which were different for each character and required the player to perform a combo to do them) were replaced by the ability of doing multiple tricks while in the air. It also added the ability to repel Weapon attacks by performing a Trick or Board Grab in the imminence of the hit. The player can also look behind by pressing the R button.</desc>

		<name>South Park</name>
		<desc>Single player takes the form of a "Story" mode divided into five episodes and fifteen linear levels. The player will face weak minions (which change based on the episode), plus occasional sub-bosses which will try to escape into town. The final level is devoted to a unique boss fight. Players use quirky weapons ranging from infinite yellow snowballs to cow launchers and toxic Terrance and Phillip dolls. Every weapon has a secondary fire, and players switch between the four main characters when they switch weapons - each of the four kids shares a single life bar because of this. The kids will comment on game actions as they occur, with heavier profanity censored with bleeps. The kids will get angrier (and fouler) as their health depletes, until they finally give up on saving the town and go home.</desc>

		<name>South Park: Chef's Luv Shack</name>
		<desc>South Park: Chef's Luv Shack is a 2D game-show style video game based on the television show South Park. It gained its popularity by having mini games and the ability to play against friends in a challenge for the most points. It also involves trivia questions about South Park and other topics.
The game intermittently switches between questions and minigames, with a minigame proceeding every three questions. Players score points by answering questions first (correctly) and based on minigame ranking. Players lose points for questions answered incorrectly. The game is exclusively multiplayer, as when played by one player, there is no AI, so that player always wins, even with a negative score</desc>

The station has since then mysteriously reappeared and it's bound on a collision course with Earth. Unless Dan and Evo can stop it, all will surely perish.

Evo makes his way through a variety of levels and worlds filled with different objectives and, of course, different animals.</desc>

		<name>Star Twins</name>
		<desc>Twins Juno and Vela, and their dog Lupus, are Jet Force Gemini, intergalactic police.  Their mission?  Stop the evil space bug, Mizar, from his goal of galactic conquest with his seemingly-infinite army of Drones.  They'll have to stop along multiple planets along the way, and assisting King Jeff and rescuing his subjects, the Tribals.

Jet Force Gemini is a third-person shooter which revels in making gigantic creepy bugs explode into dribbly mucousy bits.  The Jet Force team are given progressively more powerful weapons, from the Machine Gun, which rips through both enemies and ammo, the Plasma Shotgun, which you can charge up for some explosive fireworks, and the Tri-Rocket Launcher, which fires three rockets with every shot, sending explosive doom in the direction of your target.  There's also the Fish Food, which is used to...er, feed fish.  Really.

Even though they're called Drones, these bugs aren't stupid.  When encountered, they'll rush you, hide behind objects for cover, and even run off for reinforcements when you confront them.  They also take delight in shooting the innocent Tribals, whom you are supposed to be rescuing.  But the Drones are nothing compared to the game's insanely difficult bosses, which includes a pair of gigantic praying mantis, a huge beetle, and of course, Mizar himself, to name but a few.

Each of their team has their own special abilities - Juno can walk through lava without any trouble, Vela can swim underwater, and Lupus can hover for short distances and travel through tight spaces.  These abilities are required to fully access areas that they previously couldn't reach.  The team also get the help of Floyd the Droid, a hovering robot that can be controlled by player two as a floating gun with infinite ammo when he joins your team.

The game also includes three different multiplayer modes: Battle - featuring most options of an average First Person Shooter but with a third-person perspective, Target Shoot - a shooting gallery with a first-person view, and Racing, which includes some kart-like racing as well as old-school top down racing games.</desc>

The final episode of the game sees Aldaris and the Protoss government branding Tassadar a traitor and a heretic for conspiring with the dark templar. The player initially serves Aldaris in defending Aiur from the Zerg invasion, but while on a mission to arrest Tassadar, the player joins him instead.</desc>

The objective of the game changes depending on the mode, but generally consists of removing layers of shapes to reach the playing field's core. Despite very little domestic advertising, Tetrisphere enjoyed moderately good sales and a mostly favorable critical reception.

		<name>The New Tetris</name>
		<desc>There are several key differences in gameplay from the original Tetris. First, in addition to clearing lines, one can also form 4x4 large squares of four pieces to form 'blocks'. When a block is created, it turns solid gold or silver, depending on the makeup of the block—a block built from all the same kind of piece becomes a golden block or "monosquare", while any other combination becomes a silver block or "multisquare". Blocks can only be constructed from whole pieces: if any part of a piece has been cleared, then it cannot be used to form a block. When a line that has pieces from a block is cleared, it earns more points.</desc>

		<desc>Rainbow Six is a tactical shooter, which focuses more on stealth and tactics than on sheer firepower. To add to the realism, all in-game characters, terrorists, hostages and Rainbow operatives, can be wounded or dispatched in just fractions of a second. Tools such as thicker body armor, automatic rifles, and grenades have little value before the player grows accustomed to the gameplay.

Before each mission is a planning stage, during which the player is given a briefing, and then chooses the operatives to be involved in the mission, their weapons, equipment and uniform/camouflage. In earlier games, the player pre-established orders and waypoints during this step. The planning stage determined elements such as the path the AI-controlled squads would follow during the mission, as well as where they will deploy devices such as flashbangs or door breaching charges.</desc>

In November 2007, herpetic.adventures on the LostLevels forum posted an interesting story about a misterious file: “about 10 years ago I was poking around the Player1 website looking for info on when Robotron 64 was coming out. Just for the hell of it, I clicked the “Press Info” link. Which turned out to be an anonymous FTP. Woo. Poked around a bit, and amongst directories of PSX assets, I found robo64.zip and tommy64.zip.” Inside the zipped file, there was what it looks like an early prototype of Tommy Thunder 64 and so, thanks to herpetic.adventures, we finally have some screens from the game to look at!</desc>

		<name>Tonic Trouble</name>
		<desc>Tonic Trouble is a 3D platforming video game by Ubisoft Montreal. The story follows the main character, Ed, after a magic potion spills on the Earth and causes vegetables to become living killers. The game was received poorly; critics cite poor controls, a wordy exposition, and sloppy graphics (on the N64 version). The N64 version of the game is a port of the PC version with noticeable differences, such as a substantially different opening due to the lack of processing power needed to render cutscenes, and different music in certain places. The game is often compared to another game published by Ubisoft called Rayman 2: The Great Escape, because both are 3D platformers, both have main characters of a similar design (hands and feet without arms or legs), and both were released around the same time.</desc>

		<desc>Motorbike racer set in the Top Gear series. The Championship mode has you alternating between dirt and street racing as you compete for points. You earn new bikes and courses along the way like many other games, but interesting twist is going from one kind of racing to the other. The physics of each type of racing are very different, and you'll have to switch back and forth between dirt and racing tactics on the fly. The dirt bike racing is a lot more arcadey with all of the jumps and wide open tracks. You can earn turbo by pulling off tricks and there's really nothing to stop you from testing your stunt skills while racing except your own nerve and imagination. In this way, Hyperbike is like Hydro Thunder where you're expected to lean on that turbo button the whole time and it's up to your racing skills to ensure there's turbo available.</desc>

At the beginning of the race the player would start at the back of the grid, at the start line. Computer players at the front of the grid would often start a third of the way around the first lap. Players started with three charges of nitrous oxide, which were used to give the player a temporary speed boost.
Shortcuts were available on each track, and often the use of these decided the outcome of the races, particularly in later seasons.
At the end of each race the player would be presented with a screen to allow for various upgrades to their car, such as to acceleration and handling. The player was also able to change their car for a better (or worse) vehicle and could buy extra nitrous oxide to use in the next race.</desc>

The performance of each vehicle in the game was unique. Not only with respect to engine power, but also areas such as tire grip, suspension stiffness, steering tightness, and between different drive-trains such as front-wheel drive, rear-wheel drive, and four-wheel drive. The game also features the possibility of damaging the vehicles, although the damage does not affect performance. The game features a soundtrack consisting of tunes with a sort of trance-style. The electronic XM music was composed by Barry Leitch, who also worked on Super Nintendo Top Gear releases.</desc>

		<name>Turok 2: Seeds of Evil</name>
		<desc>Turok 2: Seeds of Evil is a first-person shooter video game originally released for the Nintendo 64 in late 1998. A port was released for Windows OS shortly afterwards, in 1999. It is the sequel to the successful Turok: Dinosaur Hunter and was followed by the 2000 entry in the series, Turok 3: Shadow of Oblivion. It is one of the first Nintendo 64 games to allow use with the RAM Expansion Pak and it was known as Violence Killer: Turok New Generation in Japan. A separate game, also titled Turok 2: Seeds of Evil, was released for the Game Boy Color in December 1998. Although set in the same fictional universe, it follows a different storyline.
 
The game was well received, garnering an 89% from the review collator Game Rankings for the Nintendo 64 version and labeled as a "must-buy" from GameSpot.</desc>

		<desc>Turok 3: Shadow of Oblivion picks up where Turok 2: Seeds of Evil left off when gamers were first introduced to "Oblivion" and its lackeys, 'Flesh Eaters. Oblivion is a monstrous cosmic entity that consumed everything in its path. It reigned before the birth of our universe. Invading the bodies of the living and devouring them from the inside-out, Oblivion fed on the very energy of the dead and dying. When the Primagen's Lightship was destroyed, the chain reaction it triggered as a result was so powerful that the universe as it existed was completely eradicated, and the almighty Oblivion was pushed to the very brink of destruction. For the first time, Oblivion felt pain, fear, and hate. Though totally ravaged, Oblivion survived and now desperately seeks a means to punch through the Netherscape that separates our world from the Lost Lands (a strange and primitive world where "time has no meaning"), and the Lost Lands from countless others. The last shreds of the pure energy source that created our world and nearly wiped out Oblivion are contained within the Light Burden, the bag that every member of the Turok lineage has carried. The death of the Turok mantle will signal the beginning of the end: the rebirth of Oblivion.</desc>

		<name>Vigilante 8</name>
		<desc>The game's storyline is built around an alternate history, in which there was a worldwide oil crisis in the 1970s and the U.S. was on the verge of an economic breakdown. Strikes, riots and crime were rampant, and all available law enforcement were brought to the cities leaving the outlands vulnerable. A foreign multinational oil consortium, Oil Monopoly Alliance Regime (OMAR), was determined to monopolize the world oil trade. The U.S. was the last country that stood in their way and they were prepared to go to any length to bring the U.S. to its knees.
OMAR hired Sid Burn, a professional terrorist, to push the U.S. economy over the edge. Sid began to organize his troops in the remote areas of the southwest. Calling themselves the "Coyotes," they began to target oil refineries, commercial installations and other vital industry throughout the region. With the law enforcement in the cities, some desperate civilians began to take the law into their own hands. Led by a trucker named Convoy and referred to simply as the "Vigilantes," this oddball group soon became a major hindrance to Sid.
Meanwhile, the U.S. government, feeling more vulnerable than ever, was intensifying its research and development of a new military arsenal. The most advanced weaponry, rumored to be based on UFO technology, was located at Site-4, a secret facility at Papoose Lake. This information was not lost on Sid, and the Coyotes ambushed the facility. However the Vigilantes unexpectedly appeared to stop them and as a result, both parties found themselves in possession of the world's most advanced weaponry.
What followed were no ordinary skirmishes. Auto clashes ensued all over the land, from Colorado's Rockies to California's farmlands, only to culminate in a battle like no other. To this day the events which took place are only a matter of speculation.</desc>

After finding an electronic armband in a service station bathroom, former Vigilante Slick Clyde rose to be controlled by OMAR. Working up through the ranks of command he soon came to be the CEO of OMAR itself and made a complete monopoly on all oil trades with the sole exception of the United States.
With the help of his student and hitman, Obake, he steals the technology to allow him to travel through time. Taking with him Obake and his cybernetic assassin, Dallas 13, he makes the jump back to 1970s to cripple the United States and bring OMAR to total domination.
Appearing in 1970s, the three vehicles encounter Convoy, the former leader of the Vigilantes. Upon seeing him, the three cars open fire.</desc>

		<desc>The sequel to Virtual Pro Wrestling 64, and released only in Japan. The title translates to Royal Road Succession; the name of the career mode in the game. The fifth wrestling game developed by AKI Corporation. Contained many improvements from previous titles that would be featured in AKI's final Nintendo 64 wrestling game WWF No Mercy. Some features, such as creating masks in edit mode and the MMA style grappling system, would not be carried over to WWF No Mercy.

Virtual Pro Wrestling 2 carries the All Japan Pro Wrestling license, and features 21 wrestlers from their promotion. The rest of the characters included in the game are based on other real promotions and wrestlers, but due to copyright have fake names and appearances. This is common among other Japanese wrestling games. You can identify who the other wrestler's are by their unique moves and taunts, and the edit mode contains each piece of ring attire you would need to recreate their actual likeness.

In total, there are 98 wrestlers in the game, 23 of which have to be unlocked. There is also 16 original character slots you can use to edit and create your own wrestlers, bringing the potential total of wrestlers in the game to 114. This game has the largest roster of all of AKI's wrestling games. In comparison, WWF No Mercy would have 64 wrestlers available.</desc>

		<desc>This game is an interactive version of the popular U.S. quiz show Wheel of Fortune complete with hostess Vanna White.

The game is played by trying to find a hidden word with only a few guesses allowed for the letters which is very similar to the pen and paper game Hangman. The other round which features the Wheel of Fortune involves you spinning the wheel which has various prizes both good and bad and whatever the pointer stops on when it stops revolving is what the player wins. This can be cash, a free spin or if you're very unlucky Bankruptcy which means you lose all the money you've earned up to that point.

Up to 3 Players can play together in multiplayer mode.</desc>

		<desc>WildWaters is an unreleased game for the Nintendo 64.

In development at Looking Glass in 1999, this kayak title was only shown behind closed doors at that year’s E3 expo. When the developer closed shop, the title disappeared. The following info was used in the announcement of the title: 

The water-based arcade racer will offer six different characters to choose from as well as three different kayak types, each with their own respective strengths and weaknesses. Wildwater will send up to two players down six perilous river courses, highlighted by realistic water physics and eye-popping graphics. Ubi Soft is promising five different gameplay modes, including Arcade, Time Trial, Championship, Finals and Versus Battle.</desc>

		<name>WinBack: Covert Operations</name>
		<desc>A terrorist group calling itself the Crying Lions is about to take over the world with its mighty satellite and Jean-Luc Cougar is the only one who can stop it. As Jean-Luc, a covert operative working for the Strategic Covert Actions Team, you are responsible for taking back a Lions-controlled base and regaining power of the satellite. Some of the weapons you'll have to acquire and use to defeat the terrorists are handguns, shotguns, and machine guns, though you'll also need to access such materials as explosives, detectors, flashlights and medical kits in order to succeed. A refreshing take on the traditional action game, WINBACK requires as much stealth and strategy as it does reflexes and use of weaponry. The game features six different multiplayer modes, supporting up to four players: Death Match, Lethal Tag, Quick Draw, Cube Hunt, Team Battle, and Point Match. You select your difficulty level and you can even start off in a Tutorial mode to get the controls down.</desc>

Like in previous installments players control highspeed hovercrafts, pick up weapons to damage the opponents' vehicles and try to finish the race in the first position. In many aspects, the gameplay is pretty similar to its predecessor, such as selection of hovercrafts, visuals or the handling system. Beside new racing tracks the main differences include a Split-Screen Multiplayer Mode (up to four players), Weapon &amp; Super Combo Challenges as well as various Special Weapons for each Team!</desc>

		<name>World Driver Championship</name>
		<desc>One of the last racing simulations to be released for Nintendo 64, this graphically intensive title used custom microcode optimization and high polygon count modelling. The development team was able to optimize the usage of the various processors within the N64 to allow far draw distance (reducing the need for fog or pop-up), high detail texturing and models, Doppler effect audio, and advanced lighting and fog effects for realistic weather conditions. Impressively the game has a high resolution 640x480 mode that does not require the add-on N64 RAM Expansion Pak. Additionally, unlike many other games of its type on the platform, the game runs high resolution at a sufficiently playable pace, undoubtedly due to the use of a reduced screen area letterbox mode that lessens the number of pixels needing to be displayed.</desc>
